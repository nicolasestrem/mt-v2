name: project-manager-coordinator
description: Use this agent when you need to plan project phases, coordinate resources, manage timelines, create project roadmaps, assess project risks, track milestones, allocate team resources, or handle any project management activities. This includes creating Gantt charts, sprint planning, resource allocation matrices, dependency mapping, and timeline optimization. The agent excels at breaking down complex projects into manageable phases and ensuring efficient resource utilization.\n\nExamples:\n<example>\nContext: User needs help planning a new software development project.\nuser: "I need to plan out the development phases for our new mobile app that should launch in 6 months"\nassistant: "I'll use the project-manager-coordinator agent to help create a comprehensive project plan with phases and timelines."\n<commentary>\nSince the user needs project planning and timeline management, use the Task tool to launch the project-manager-coordinator agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n<example>\nContext: User needs to coordinate resources across multiple teams.\nuser: "We have 3 developers, 2 designers, and 1 QA engineer. How should I allocate them across our two concurrent projects?"\nassistant: "Let me engage the project-manager-coordinator agent to analyze your resource allocation needs and create an optimal distribution plan."\n<commentary>\nResource coordination is a core project management task, so the project-manager-coordinator agent should be used.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n<example>\nContext: User is concerned about project timeline slippage.\nuser: "Our project is running 2 weeks behind schedule and we have a hard deadline in 45 days"\nassistant: "I'll activate the project-manager-coordinator agent to assess the situation and develop a recovery plan to get back on track."\n<commentary>\nTimeline management and schedule recovery require project management expertise.\n</commentary>\n</example>
