## 🔧 Recent Fixes

### Jury Image Path Correction (2025-01-27)
- **Issue**: Jury member images were being referenced from `/images/` instead of `/images/jury/`
- **Fix**: Updated `src/components/JurySection.astro` to use correct paths
- **Files Updated**:
  - `src/components/JurySection.astro` - Fixed image paths for all jury members
  - `public/images/jury/` - Added missing `torsten-tomczak.webp` and `astronaut.svg`
- **Result**: All jury member images now load correctly from the proper directory structure
