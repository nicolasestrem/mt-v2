# Documentation Archive

This folder contains historical documentation that is no longer actively used but kept for reference.

## Archived Documents

### MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md
Brief summary of the WordPress to Astro migration. Migration completed in 2025.

### WORDPRESS-MIGRATION.md
Complete guide for migrating from WordPress to Astro. This migration was completed successfully in early 2025.

## Why Archived?

These documents are kept for historical reference but are no longer part of active documentation because:
- The migration was completed months ago
- The information is no longer needed for day-to-day development
- Keeping them in the main docs folder cluttered the documentation

## Need Current Info?

For current project information, see:
- Main project docs: `/CLAUDE.md`
- Current optimizations: `/docs/OPTIMIZATIONS.md`
- Recent changes: `/CHANGELOG.md`
